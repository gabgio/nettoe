-- $Id: ChangeLog for netToe version 1.5.1 --
---------------------------------------------
21 March 2014:
  - Export NETTOE_LDADD to subdirectories.
    It contains linking needed for terminfo/curses.
  - Have the test program always return success,
    even when TERM is not set. In the latter case,
    use 'dumb' as terminal type.

18 November 2013:
  - Optionally install a file for Debian's menu system.
  - Make 'applicationsdir', 'iconsdir', 'menudir', and
    'pixmapsdir' into precious configuration variables.
    Simplify their use in templates.
  - Check return status of fgets(), scanf(), and system()
    for better diagnostics.

1 August 2013:
  - Let the configure script mention location of icons.
  - Add a section about AI in the manual.

31 July 2013:
  - New files "src/ai.c", "src/board.c", "src/board.h",
    containing refactored portions of code, and created
    for easier expansion and analysis.
  - Let the AI code in middle level of difficulty be more
    aggressive in the sense of attempting winning moves first,
    then blocking moves. One rule replaced in order to have
    attacks at every field of the board.

30 July 2013:
  - More refactoring.
  - Use isatty() to abort non-interactive uses.

29 July 2013:
  - Much refactoring and simplification of code.
  - Visual improvements and uniform messages.
  - Allow 'q' to end all menus, all allow letter.

26 July 2013:
  - Fair randomization, removing some bugs.
  - Better optical consistency. New messages.

25 July 2013:
  - Desktop adaption: optioinal icons and description.
  - Fall back to menu, instead of aborting program.
    This improves the usability for desktop users.

14 May 2013:
  - Prefer ncurses on OpenSolaris. Detect it correctly.
  - Support autoconf-2.69 and automake-1.13.1.
  - Make TCP port configurable at build time.

7 May 2013:
  - Improve configure.in and some macro usage.

4 May 2013:
  - Revise the manual page.

25 April 2013:
  - Support clang on FreeBSD.
  - Curses support by default.

30 December 2011:
  - Full support for terminfo and termcap.
  - Main menu allows answering with a character a alternative
    to digits. The character is indicated in colour.
  - Give away SUID and GUID for safety.

17 March 2010:
  - A compatibility alteration for the listen socket in the network
    server code. Now glibc version 2.3, 2.7, and 2.10 behave identically
    as to their ability to build a passive IPv6 socket. Contempory
    libraries like glibc 2.10 use another response order in the resolver.

26 February 2010:
  -Trivial misprint in user interaction.

24 February 2010:
  - IPv6-able network code.
  - Dual stacked IPv4/IPv6 listening socket for Linux and FreeBSD.
    OpenBSD users must relax 'net.inet6.ip6.v6only=0' to use both
	address families.
  - Using a single socket pair in network mode.
  - The only fixed tcp port in use is server-side 7501.
  - Both network sides are able to capture an interrupted
    network connection. They now exit gracefully.
  - Input sanitation to avoid threats for buffer overruns.
  - The name of a player can now contain spaces. Any input
    white space is collaps and normalized. Custom string parsing.

3 January 2010:
  - Fixed Makefile.am in order to avoid duplicate traversal of './docs/'.
  - Rebuild the autotool files and declare this as release 1.2.1.

30 December 2009:
  - Mats Erik Andersson has joined the project.
  - Background colour and default text colour now follows whatever
    choice the terminal is configured for.
  - A board randomization is used in AI-mode. This enhances the
    subjective impression of play variations.
  - A harder AI-mode has been implemented. It detects all winning moves
    for the computer, and also detects every immediate threat the
    user is able to pose.
  - The network protocol has been implemented anew, which fixes
    some dubious or incorrect code passages in the previous releases.
  - Use socket option SO_REUSEADDR to quickly reenable network play.

22 July 2001:
  - Completed the code section regarding colors.
  - netToe now uses colors !

21 July 2001:
  - Modified the parse_cmd_args(...) function to accept more than one
    argument at time, option --no-colors added. (ref: misc.c)	
  - Added modules terminal.c and terminal.h Those file include the new
    code to handle colors in nettoe. 
  - Added modules matrices.c and matrices.h Those files include the new 
    code to handle the nettoe board matrix. 
  - Removed netmisc.c and netmisc.h modules and  included the code in the
    network.c and network.h modules. 

01 July 2001:
  - Written a short HOW TO PLAY guide in the README file.
  - Written and included int the package a man page for nettoe.

30 June 2001:
  - Added the -Wall option check in configure.in (if the compiler is gcc)
  - Fixed ALL the compilation warnings produced by gcc with -Wall
    That was a huge list of warnings :-)
  - Added checking for many includes in configure.in

29 June 2001:
  - Added command line argument parsing to netToe. (ref: misc.c)
    --no-beep option added.   
  - Added a beep function to beep the user everytime he has
    to make a move or take a decision. (ref: misc.c)

28 June 2001:
  - Added support for autotools (autoconf,automake etc..)
  - Fixed bug that caused nettoe to exit when the infos
    screen was displayed. (ref: misc.c, print_infos_screen() )

24 June 2001:
  - nettoe 1.0.5 is in Debian unstable, thanks to Andras Bali.
