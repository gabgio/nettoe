 List of known bugs, or their solutions:

nettoe-1.3.2 (17 March 2010):
  - Inability of eglibc 2.10 to listen on IPv6 has been resolved.

nettoe-1.3.0 (24 February 2010):
  - The previous problems with premature socket closedown are solved.
  - All uses of scanf() for strings are now using a length limit.

nettoe-1.2.1 (3 January 2010):
nettoe-1.2.0 (30 December 2009):
  - No new bugs known at this time. The code has been tested with
    Debian GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD.
  - The effect of premature socket closedown from the client has
    not been addressed in this release, so the defect will persist.
  - The networking protocol code has been revised for reliability.
    Some defects were located and the high load should not occur
    anymore, since the sockets transfer well defined content.
