This text explains the message protocol used by netToe
in case the network game mode is used.

1. Initiation: each side writes the name of the player,
   containing a character string of exactly 32 bytes length:
  
   Server: char name[32].
   Client: char name[32].

2. The server tosses a coin in order to choose who plays first.
   The name of this starting player is transmitted to the client:
   
   Server: char name[32].
   Client: -

3. The server sends a single character, either '1' or '2', encoding
   the starting side. The server identifies '1' as himself, and '2'
   as the client.

   Server: char.
   Client: -

4. Transmission of board after a player's move. The server side uses
   the marker 'X' and the client side uses 'O'. This fourth step is
   repeated as many times as is needed until a game ends.

   a. Transmit "y" as char str[2], including ending null.
      This start signal is common to all information exchanges
      once the initial steps 1 -- 3 have been completed.

   b. Transmit the full board. This makes for nine bytes,
      as char str[9], sent in the order indicated by the
      following board:

             0 | 1 | 2
            -----------
	     3 | 4 | 5
            -----------
             6 | 7 | 9

   c. Send identifying stop signal, telling which party was the
      origin of the just transmitted board:
        Server: "S", meaning char str[2] with null.
        Client: "C", likewise.

      The other party must recognize for this stop signal before
      proceeding the game exchange.

When a winner has been found, or a draw has occurred, a negotiation
for continued gaming commences.

5. The player using the server gets to decide if he wants to continue
   or not. 

   a. The server sends "y" as char str[2], including final null.
   b. The server sends "n" or "y" as char str[2], depending on
      whether the first player says "no" or "yes".

6. In the case where 5b. transmits "n", the game is discontinued.
   Otherwise, the client side performs the corresponding transaction:

   a. The client sends "y" in the form of char str[2].
   b. The client sends either "n" or "y" as char str[2], depending
      on the player's decision to continue, or not.

7. In the case where 6b. resulted in "y", the transaction scheme
   continues at step 3.


Observe that there is a two character string "y\0" used as an initial
transmission hook in most situations, and that an ending hook "S\0",
or "C\0", is used to identify which part is sending the board with
current playing positions.
